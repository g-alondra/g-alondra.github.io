    <td>GPS Tiny Shield </td>

    <td>$65.95</td>
    <td> The tiny shield will give me a better outdoor signal which is where most 
         pets are when lost. I’ll connect the GPS to the Duino processor so that I’m 
      able to program the GPS to the application.</td>

    <td>$43.95</td>
   <td> The kit is cheaper than if I bought everything separately. Eventually, I’d 
    need to buy a battery to power the GPS whether its lithium or one of the coin batteries, 
    they cost the same. The USB board allows me to program my tinyduino processor, which is 
    what will connect the tracker to the application.</td>
