<h2> Project Proposal</h2>
                   
                    <h3> 1.	Project Title </h3>
                   <p>  a.	Find My Pet </p> 
                    <h3>2. Project Description</h3>
                  <OL TYPE="a">
             <li>   	Create an app that alerts owners when their pets are out of a certain range.  </li> 
 <li>     	Final project: I will present the movement of the dog tag and how you can see it from the application on your phone.  </li>
   <li>   	Trying to solve: I am trying to save a pet owner from having an emotional heart break of losing their pet. As well as the waste of paper that says, “Lost dog” or “Found dog”.  </li> </OL>
                    <h3>3.Goals </h3>
                    <OL TYPE= "a">
<p>	To integrate a GPS into a dog tag. </p>
                      <p>To make an android application for user interface. </p> </OL>
                 
<p>	i. Create a code that will connect to the dog tag. </p>
<p>	ii. Have a map of the world on the application.</p>
<p>	iii. Create a code that will alert pet owners when their pet is out of range. </p>
<p>	iv. Allow pet owners to set a range (in miles (1,3,5) ) from their pets location.</p>
      <p>    	v.Create a dismiss feature, that pet owners can press either on the dog tag or phone application when the pet is out of range, but with them. </p> 
                    <h3>4.	Ways to Scale back Project </h3>
<p>Instead of making an application,</p>
<p>-	Create a very simple website, with only the required material</p>
    <p>  -	Or, have the dog tag send a text message to the pet owner, notifying that their pet has left the range given. </p> 
                    <h3> 5.	Reach Goal for Project </h3>
<p>a.	Customize the dog collar. Ex: Waterproof, light-weight, says their name, etc.</p>
  <p>   b.	Transfer the tracking device to a watch.</p>
  <p>  c.	Add other features onto the dog tag. Ex: Monitors amount of exercise, the amount of water/food they’ve had, their heart rate. </p>
  <p>  d.	Make it as affordable as possible. </p>
<p>e.	On the application have a settings for at least two different types of languages. </p>
<p>f.	Create a Log in account for the application in case the pet owner has multiple pets. </p>
<p>g.	Create a code that allows for multiple pets to be viewed with one account. </p>
                    <h3>6.	Risks or Potential Challenges </h3>
 <p>   a.	Underestimating the simplicity of GPS and not being able to connect it to the application or have it pop up to show the exact location and range. </p>
  <p>  b.	The tag can explode if not protected carefully. For example if it has a battery and is accidently punctured or being charged in a very low or high temperatures. </p>
  <p>  c.	This being my first time applying python into an actual object may be difficult, especially since I don’t know all the terms and their function very well. Therefore working with software will definitely be a challenge.</p>
                    <h3>7.	Reasons for Selecting this Project </h3>
<p>a.	It’s a reasonable project- within budget and possibly time.</p>
<p>b.	I will be saving trees (“lost dog”).</p>
<p>c.	I will save pet owners from emotional heart break. </p>
  <p>  d.	7.6 million pets are lost each year, so with an affordable tracking device I will be saving pets from losing their home. </p>
