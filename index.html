<h3> Welcome to my website!</h3>
<p> I am Alondra Gonzalez, a senior in Canoga Park High School. This website is intended for updates on my second year High School Involvement Program
with Northrop Grumman. Just to give you an idea of who I am, here are some facts about me. I am president of both Academic Decathlon and 
the robotics team at my High School. In the summer of 2016 I interned in a bioengineering lab at the University of California, Los Angeles
for two months. I've been swimming for as long as I can remember and I train to run marathons. Whenever I have some extra time to spare
I love to watch TV shows on Netflix. </p>
