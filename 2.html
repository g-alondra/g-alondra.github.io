Working with programming languages such as python, java, HTML&CSS has not been a simple journey. Personally, it has taken me a while to 
really be able to remember the small details (ex. semicolons and when to put quotation marks). Especially getting into the mindset of 
thinking in terms of these languages. I’ve found though that the more I continue to practice the more I am able to remember. 
Additionally, I’ve found plenty of online sources that give examples and explain what each item does. Such sources consist of:  
 <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">www.w3schools.com/html/</a>, <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/">www.htmlgoodies.com/</a>,and
 <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">www.codecademy.com/</a>.</p>
