 <p><h4 style="font-family:arial;" style="font-size:170%;">  The original idea for this project was to program a GPS shield to send its location via WIFI to an android app. 
   The app was meant to alert the user if their pet had left a certain distance from their home. </p>
<p>
  What I was able to do: </p>
  <p>- Program the GPS to show it's coordinates. </p>
  <p>- Program WIFI shield to scan for networks and connect. </p>
  <p>- Install google maps on to my git hub website. </p>
  <p>- Show current location on google maps with the use of a marker, and address information. </p>
 <p> - Create a Log-in and Sign-up page. </p>
<p>
  Was unable to:</p>
  <p>- Connect both the GPS and WIFI code to work together. </p>
 <p> - Send alert notifications. </p>
