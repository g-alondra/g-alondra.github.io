<p><h3> Hello, I am Alondra Gonzalez, a senior at Canoga Park High School. This website is intended for updates on my second year
High School Involvement (H.I.P) project with Northrop Grumman </h3> </p>


<p>  I am president of both Academic Decathlon and the robotics team at my High School. In the summer of 2016 I interned in a bioengineering lab at the University of California, Los Angeles
for two months. I've been swimming for as long as I can remember and I train to run marathons. Whenever I have some extra time to spare
I love to watch TV shows on Netflix. </p>
