 <p>  The original idea for this project was to program a GPS shield to send its location via WIFI to an android app. 
   The app was meant to alert the user if their pet had left a certain distance from their home. </p>
<p>
What I was able to do:
- Program the GPS to show it's coordinates.
- Program WIFI shield to scan for networks and connect. 
- Install google maps on to my git hub website. 
- Show current location on google maps with the use of a marker, and address information. 
  - Create a Log-in and Sign-up page. </p>
<p>
Was unable to:
- Connect both the GPS and WIFI code to work together. 
  - Send alert notifications. </p>
