<body> 
     <p>  Utilizing Code Academy to learn about Python and HTML has not been as diffficult as I had expected. </p>
<p> - HTML is simple when you know the basic codes and how they interact with other languages such as CSS. </p>
<p>- Python is also simple, but it takes a longer time to learn. </p>
       <p>- It takes a long time to go over the tutorials so it is necessary to really know how to budget your time when you're on a deadline </p>
