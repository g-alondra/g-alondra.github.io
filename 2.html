<h1> Working with Python and HTML </h1>

<body> 
 <h3>  Utilizing Code Academy to learn about Python and HTML has not been as diffficult as I had expected.</h3>
<p> - HTML is simple when you know the basic codes and how it interacts with other languages such as CSS. </p>
<p>- Python is also simple, but it takes a longer time to learn. </p>
<p>- It takes a long time to go over the tutorials so it is necessary to really know how to budget your time when you're on a deadline. </p>
