<h2> Project Proposal</h2>
<h4> 1.	Project Title
          a.	Find My Pet 
2. Project Description
      a.	Create an app that alerts owners when their pets are out of a certain range. 
      b.	Final project: I will present the movement of the dog tag and how you can see it from the application on your phone. 
      c.	Trying to solve: I am trying to save a pet owner from having an emotional heart break of losing their pet. As well as the waste of paper that says, “Lost dog” or “Found dog”. 
3.	 Goals 
      a.	To integrate a GPS into a dog tag. 
      b.	To make an android application for user interface. 
          i.	Create a code that will connect to the dog tag. 
          ii.	Have a map of the world on the application.
          iii.	Create a code that will alert pet owners when their pet is out of range. 
          iv.	Allow pet owners to set a range (in miles (1,3,5) ) from their pets location.
          v.	Create a dismiss feature, that pet owners can press either on the dog tag or phone application when the pet is out of range, but with them. 
4.	Way to Scale back project 
  Instead of making an application,
      -	Create a very simple website, with only the required material
      -	Or, have the dog tag send a text message to the pet owner, notifying that their pet has left the range given.  
5.	Reach goal for project 
    a.	Customize the dog collar. Ex: Waterproof, light-weight, says their name, etc.
    b.	Transfer the tracking device to a watch.
    c.	Add other features onto the dog tag. Ex: Monitors amount of exercise, the amount of water/food they’ve had, their heart rate. 
    d.	Make it as affordable as possible. 
    e.	On the application have a settings for at least two different types of languages.
    f.	Create a Log in account for the application in case the pet owner has multiple pets. 
    g.	Create a code that allows for multiple pets to be viewed with one account. 
6.	Risks or potential challenges 
    a.	Underestimating the simplicity of GPS and not being able to connect it to the application or have it pop up to show the exact location and range. 
    b.	The tag can explode if not protected carefully. For example if it has a battery and is accidently punctured or being charged in a very low or high temperatures. 
    c.	This being my first time applying python into an actual object may be difficult, especially since I don’t know all the terms and their function very well. Therefore working with software will definitely be a challenge.
7.	Reasons for selecting this project 
    a.	It’s a reasonable project- within budget and possibly time.
    b.	I will be saving trees (“lost dog”).
    c.	I will save pet owners from emotional heart break. 
    d.	7.6 million pets are lost each year, so with an affordable tracking device I will be saving pets from losing their home.
